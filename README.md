# Dice-Game

###### Dice Game is a basic game that has following rules:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result get added to his/her round score.
- If the player rolls a 1, all his/her round score gets lost. After that, it is the next player's turn.
- The player can choose the "Hold", which means that his/her round score gets added to his global score. 
- The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.
